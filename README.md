# chaos-games
Fractal image generator created as a final project for an introductory computer science course.

The program enables for users to specify a large number of rule sets at run time enabling for a large variety of interesting fractals to be generated. This project targets Python 2.7 and depends on the discontinued Python Imaging Library. The Pillow library can be installed as a replacement.
